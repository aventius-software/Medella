# Medella

Medella aims to (one day...) be a complete open source EPR (Electronic Patient Record). It is being designed in mind to be used primarily within the U.K. NHS (National Health Service), whether that be a hospital, GP surgery or community health centre. So, in other words, everywhere for everyone in the NHS ;-)

It is designed by mostly ex-NHS (and some current NHS) employees, with decades of experience in the NHS in the fields of data engineering, application development, business intelligence, data warehousing and information analysis. With many of us having worked in the NHS for years, we've seen countless expensive, complicated to use (for end users and IT support) systems purchased and implemented only for them not to provide what is really needed... with this project we aim to try to solve all those issues and more.

Note that this project is currently only in very early stages and currently not recommended for any type of production or live usage. However, eventually we hope to build something that is reliable, easy to use for both end users and IT professionals (especially for them to manage and maintain).

# Goals

- A free open source alternative to extremely expensive and closed off commercial systems such an EPR (Electronic Patient Record) and/or PAS (Patient Administration System)
- Simple to use for the public, medical professionals, administrators and IT professionals
- Cover all aspects of NHS health support, such as community, primary/secondary care and patient facing (e.g. patient app for accessing their own health record)
- Cloud first hosting model which is easy to setup, manage and host, whilst being considerably cheaper than purchasing a new system usually costing in the millions of pounds (GBP)
- Conforming to the latest IG (Information Governance) and data governance standards required by the NHS
- Following data sets, data items and standards laid out in the NHS data dictionary and accompanying datasets
- Back end database and front end applications designed with the latest standards and technology
- Desktop, web and mobile friendly
- Modular so to be easy to expand to add new modules for services
- Highly testable (e.g. unit testing) applications and databases
- Output for national returns and datasets
- Easy to use and integrate with data warehousing, business intelligence, reporting and analysis. For analysis at local, strategic area and national levels
- Integration with other existing health systems using standards such as FHIR etc...

We may in addition to this create other projects such as data analysis (as mentioned above) so that realtime insights can be performed (all in accordance with IG) on the data
